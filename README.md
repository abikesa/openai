   gradual iterative development of `agents`:: [GPTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk) (publishable)
   - [Safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk) best approached this way
     - Do regulators do the same or they issue monstrous laws to stiffle this sort of free, responsible, iteration?
     - Key argument for essay with Charles
     - The [Board ousted Altman](https://www.wsj.com/tech/sam-altman-departs-open-ai-mira-murati-interim-ceo-41f6d51e) shortly after this
       - One source of tension between Altman and some board members was around whether OpenAI was fully considering the safety implications of the products it has rolled out as part of its rapid expansion of commercial offerings, people familiar with the matter said.

   - User experience = ethics quite literally; and the individual users in the market place have spoken loudly in response to ChatGPT
   - AI has been here and nothing revolutionary in the models happenned between 11/2022-11/2023; its just the chat interface!
   - This is the spice that hands `agency` to one who has been denied it by forces of history and biology; `empowering`
