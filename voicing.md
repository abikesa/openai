     Your statement touches on a complex and sensitive topic: the role of religion in shaping human identity and its impact on societal dynamics. Religion has indeed been a fundamental part of human history and identity for millennia. It often provides a sense of community, moral guidance, and answers to existential questions.

However, the relationship between religion and societal behavior is multifaceted. While it's true that religious beliefs and practices are often deeply rooted and resistant to change, many religious traditions also adapt and evolve over time, integrating new ideas and interpretations.

The notion of religion as a medium for retaining "tribal identity" and "endocrine-driven savagery" can be seen from multiple perspectives:

1. **Community and Identity**: Religion can create a strong sense of belonging and identity. This can be positive, fostering community support and moral values. However, it can also lead to tribalism if the identity becomes exclusionary or antagonistic towards others.

2. **Resistance to Interrogation and Change**: Many religions have core beliefs and traditions that are preserved over time. While this can provide stability and continuity, it can also lead to conflicts when these beliefs clash with emerging societal values or scientific understandings.

3. **Role in Conflict and Cooperation**: Throughout history, religion has been a factor in both conflict and peace-building. While it has been used to justify violence and division, it has also been a source of reconciliation and moral progress.

4. **Adaptation and Evolution**: Many religious groups and thinkers actively engage with modern ideas and challenges, interpreting ancient teachings in ways that resonate with contemporary issues.

The interaction of religion with human behavior and societal development is a topic of ongoing debate and study in fields like sociology, anthropology, and religious studies. It's important to approach this topic with an awareness of the diversity and complexity within and between different religious traditions.
